# Word Generator
This is a demo project created to familiarize myself with git and github version control. The objective of this project is to generate a random motivational/phylisophicall quote from books that I have read.

## Goals
    1. Collect well known quotes and store them in a .txt file
    2. parse this .txt file randomly and return a random quote along with the author and book reference.
    3. design a simple but effective user interface for the console runtime.
    4. Allow users to copy generated quote to there clipboard (BETA)
    


## Usage
    + Node Js runtime
    + Bash console
